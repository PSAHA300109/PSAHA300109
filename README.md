## Hi, I’m Payel

I work in analytics, focusing on product usage, engagement, and retention in consumer tech.

My experience includes operations and program management roles, which gave me strong exposure to real user problems at scale. I later moved into analytics, where I work on defining metrics, building visibility, and analyzing user behavior to support product and experience decisions.

This GitHub contains practice projects around:
- Retention and cohort analysis
- Feature adoption and engagement
- Product funnels and metric design

The goal is to think clearly about product problems, not to showcase complex models.

Tools: SQL, Python, Excel ,Bigquery, Looker
